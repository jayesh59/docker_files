    # PORT is setting the env variable but need to have PORT as a variable in host machine's variables
    # -p <prefix> : sets the prefix for the docker services which allows to launch multiple instances of containers.
      # still need to change the <prefix> name for each instance somehow. but as planning to run this command as a response to 
      # a request to the webserver or something so this can actually be dynamically set using some logic.
